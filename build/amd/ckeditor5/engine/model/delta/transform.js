  * deltas are more complicated than operations and have they semantic meaning, as they represent user's editing intentions.
  *
  * Sometimes, simple operational transformation on deltas' operations might result in some unexpected results. Those
  * results would be fine from OT point of view, but would not reflect user's intentions. Because of such conflicts
  * we need to handle transformations in special cases in a custom way.
  *
  * The function itself looks whether two given delta types have a special case function registered. If so, the deltas are
  * transformed using that function. If not, {@link engine.model.delta.defaultTransform default transformation algorithm}
  * is used.

					// Note, that we process single operation but the operationTransform result might be an array, so we
					// might splice-in more operations. We will process them further in next iterations. Right now we

				// So in next iterator loop we will take another operation from delta B and use transformed delta A (`ops`)
				// to transform it further.
