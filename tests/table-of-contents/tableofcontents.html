		<h2>Rosetta</h2>

		<p><strong>Rosetta</strong> is a space probe built by the <strong>European Space Agency</strong> launched on 2 March 2004. Along with Philae, its lander module, Rosetta is performing a detailed study of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P).[6][7] On 6 August 2014, the spacecraft reached the comet and performed a series of manoeuvres to be captured in its orbit. On 12 November, the lander module performed the first successful landing on a comet. As of 2015, the mission continues to return data from the spacecraft in orbit and from the lander in the comet's surface. During its journey to the comet, the spacecraft flew by Mars and the asteroids 21 Lutetia and 2867 Šteins.[9][10][11]</p>

		<h3>Mission overview</h3>	

		<p>Rosetta was launched on 2 March 2004 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket and reached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 6 August 2014,[15] becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet.[16][17][18] (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.)[19] It is one of ESA's Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions.[20] The spacecraft consists of the Rosetta orbiter, which features 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with nine additional instruments.[21] The Rosetta mission will orbit Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko for 17 months and is designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft is controlled from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany.[22] The planning for the operation of the scientific payload, together with the data retrieval, calibration, archiving and distribution, is performed from the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain.[23] It has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014, some 2,000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity.[24]</p>
		
		<h3>History</h3>

		<h4>Background</h4>

		<p>During the 1986 approach of Halley's Comet, international space probes were sent to explore the comet, most prominent among them being ESA's Giotto. After the probes returned valuable scientific information, it became obvious that follow-ons were needed that would shed more light on cometary composition and answer new questions.</p>

		<p>Both ESA and NASA started cooperatively developing new probes. The NASA project was the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission. The ESA project was the follow-on Comet Nucleus Sample Return (CNSR) mission. Both missions were to share the Mariner Mark II spacecraft design, thus minimising costs. In 1992, after NASA cancelled CRAF due to budgetary limitations, ESA decided to develop a CRAF-style project on its own. By 1993 it was evident that the ambitious sample return mission was infeasible with the existing ESA budget, so the mission was redesigned and subsequently approved by the ESA,[24] with the final flight plan resembling the cancelled CRAF mission: an asteroid flyby followed by a comet rendezvous with in-situ examination, including a lander. After the spacecraft launch, Gerhard Schwehm was named mission manager; he retired in March 2014.[24]</p>

		<h4>Mission firsts</h4>

		<p>The Rosetta mission planned to achieve many historic firsts.[34]</p>

		<p>On its way to comet 67P, Rosetta passed through the main asteroid belt, and made the first European close encounter with several of these primitive objects. Rosetta was the first spacecraft to fly close to Jupiter's orbit using solar cells as its main power source.</p>

		<p>Rosetta is the first spacecraft to orbit a comet nucleus,[35] and is the first spacecraft to fly alongside a comet as it heads towards the inner Solar System. It is planned to be the first spacecraft to examine at close proximity how a frozen comet is transformed by the warmth of the Sun. Shortly after its arrival at 67P, the Rosetta orbiter dispatched the Philae lander for the first controlled touchdown on a comet nucleus. The robotic lander's instruments obtained the first images from a comet's surface and made the first in-situ analysis of its composition.</p>

		<h4>Design and construction</h4>

		<p>The Rosetta bus is a 2.8 × 2.1 × 2.0 m (9.2 × 6.9 × 6.6 ft) central frame and aluminium honeycomb platform. Its total mass is approximately 2,900 kg (6,400 lb), which includes the 100 kg (220 lb) Philae lander and 165 kg (364 lb) of science instruments. The Payload Support Module is mounted on top of the spacecraft and houses the scientific instruments, while the Bus Support Module is on the bottom and contains spacecraft support subsystems. Heaters placed around the spacecraft keep its systems warm while it is distant from the Sun. Rosetta's communications suite includes a 2.2 m (7.2 ft) steerable high-gain parabolic dish antenna, a 0.8 m (2.6 ft) fixed-position medium-gain antenna, and two omnidirectional low-gain antennas.[36]</p>

		<p>Electrical power for the spacecraft comes from two solar arrays totalling 64 square metres (690 sq ft).[37] Each solar array is subdivided into five solar panels, with each panel being 2.25 × 2.736 m (7.38 × 8.98 ft). The individual solar cells are made of silicon, 200 μm thick, and 61.95 × 37.75 mm (2.44 × 1.49 in).[38] The solar arrays generate a maximum of approximately 1,500 watts at perihelion,[38] a minimum of 400 watts in hibernation mode at 5.2 AU, and 850 watts when comet operations begin at 3.4 AU.[36] Spacecraft power is controlled by a redundant Terma power module also used in the Mars Express spacecraft,[39][40] and is stored in four 10-A·h NiCd batteries supplying 28 volts to the bus.[36]</p>

		<p>Main propulsion comprises 24 paired bipropellant 10 N thrusters,[37] with four pairs of thrusters being used for delta-v burns. The spacecraft carried 1,719.1 kg (3,790 lb) of propellant at launch: 659.6 kg (1,454 lb) of monomethylhydrazine fuel and 1,059.5 kg (2,336 lb) of dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser, contained in two 1,108-litre (244 imp gal; 293 US gal) grade 5 titanium alloy tanks and providing delta-v of at least 2,300 metres per second (7,500 ft/s) over the course of the mission. Propellant pressurisation is provided by two 68-litre (15 imp gal; 18 US gal) high-pressure helium tanks.[41]</p>

		<h4>Launch</h4>

		<p>Rosetta was set to be launched on 12 January 2003 to rendezvous with the comet 46P/Wirtanen in 2011.</p>

		<p>This plan was abandoned after the failure of an Ariane 5 carrier rocket during Hot Bird 7's launch on 11 December 2002, grounding it until the cause of the failure could be determined. A new plan was formed to target the comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko, with a revised launch date of 26 February 2004 and comet rendezvous in 2014. The larger mass and the resulting increased impact velocity made modification of the landing gear necessary.[44] After two scrubbed launch attempts, Rosetta was launched on 2 March 2004 at 7:17 GMT from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. Aside from the changes made to launch time and target, the mission profile remained almost identical.</p>

		<h4>Deep space manoeuvres</h4>

		<p>To achieve the required velocity to rendezvous with 67P, Rosetta used gravity assist manoeuvres to accelerate throughout the inner Solar System. The comet's orbit was known before Rosetta's launch, from ground-based measurements, to an accuracy of approximately 100 km (62 mi). Information gathered by the onboard cameras beginning at a distance of 24 million kilometres (15,000,000 mi) were processed at ESA's Operation Centre to refine the position of the comet in its orbit to a few kilometres.</p>

		<p>The first Earth flyby was on 4 March 2005.</p>

		<p>On 25 February 2007, the craft was scheduled for a low-altitude flyby of Mars, to correct the trajectory. This was not without risk, as the estimated altitude of the flyby was a mere 250 kilometres (160 mi). During that encounter, the solar panels could not be used since the craft was in the planet's shadow, where it would not receive any solar light for 15 minutes, causing a dangerous shortage of power. The craft was therefore put into standby mode, with no possibility to communicate, flying on batteries that were originally not designed for this task.[45] This Mars manoeuvre was therefore nicknamed "The Billion Euro Gamble".[46] The flyby was successful, with Rosetta even returning detailed images of the surface and atmosphere of the planet, and the mission continued as planned.[9][25]</p>

		<p>The second Earth flyby was on 13 November 2007 at a distance of 5,700 km (3,500 mi).[47][48] In observations made on 7 and 8 November, Rosetta was briefly mistaken for a near-Earth asteroid about 20 m (66 ft) in diameter by an astronomer of the Catalina Sky Survey and was given the provisional designation 2007 VN84.[49] Calculations showed that it would pass very close to Earth, which led to speculation that it could impact Earth.[50] However, astronomer Denis Denisenko recognised that the trajectory matched that of Rosetta, which the Minor Planet Center confirmed in an editorial release on 9 November.[51][52]</p>

		<h2>Orbit around 67P</h2>

		<p>In August 2014, Rosetta rendezvoused with the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P) and commenced a series of manoeuvres that took it on two successive triangular paths, averaging 100 and 50 kilometres (62 and 31 mi) from the nucleus, whose segments are hyperbolic escape trajectories alternating with thruster burns.[16][17] After closing to within about 30 km (19 mi) from the comet on 10 September, the spacecraft entered actual orbit about it.[16][17][18][dated info]</p>

		<p>The surface layout of 67P was unknown before Rosetta's arrival. The orbiter mapped the comet in anticipation of detaching its lander.[56] By 25 August 2014, five potential landing sites had been determined.[57] On 15 September 2014, ESA announced Site J, named Agilkia in honour of Agilkia Island by an ESA public contest and located on the "head" of the comet,[58] as the lander's destination.[59]</p>

		<h3>Philae lander</h3>

		<p>Philae detached from Rosetta on 12 November 2014 at 08:35 UTC, and approached 67P at a relative speed of about 1 m/s (3.6 km/h; 2.2 mph).[60] It initially landed on 67P at 15:33 UTC, but bounced twice, coming to rest at 17:33 UTC.[8][61] Confirmation of contact with 67P reached Earth at 16:03 UTC.[62]</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>

		<p>One of the first discoveries was that the magnetic field of 67P oscillated at 40–50 millihertz. Scientists modified the signal by speeding it up 10,000 times so that people could hear a rendition of it. While a natural phenomenon, it has been described as a "song",[68] and has been compared to Continuum for harpsichord by György Ligeti.[69] However, results from Philae's landing show that the comet's nucleus has no magnetic field, and that the field originally detected by Rosetta likely resulted from the influence of solar winds.[70][71]</p>
